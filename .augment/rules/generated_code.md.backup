Ensure that all code generated by AI is clearly and consistently marked, so developers, reviewers, and auditors can easily identify where the code starts and ends.

**Please surround all generated code with banner-style comments for clear identification. Use the correct comment syntax for the language.**

For example:

### Line-comment Languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
```
// ===== BEGIN GENERATED BY AI =====
// ===== END GENERATED BY AI =====
```
or
```
# ===== BEGIN GENERATED BY AI =====
# ===== END GENERATED BY AI =====
```

### Block-comment Languages (HTML, CSS, etc.)
```
<!-- ===== BEGIN GENERATED BY AI ===== -->
<!-- ===== END GENERATED BY AI ===== -->
```
