# Augment Guidelines

When generating code, please surround any code blocks with comments indicating they were generated by Augment.

For example in JavaScript/TypeScript:
```javascript
// --- Begin Augment generated code ---
function exampleFunction() {
  return "Hello world";
}
// --- End Augment generated code ---
```

For Python:
```python
# --- Begin Augment generated code ---
def example_function():
    return "Hello world"
# --- End Augment generated code ---
```

For Lua:
```lua
-- --- Begin Augment generated code ---
local function example_function()
  return "Hello world"
end
-- --- End Augment generated code ---
```

Please adapt the comment style to the appropriate language syntax while maintaining the "Begin/End Augment generated code" markers.
